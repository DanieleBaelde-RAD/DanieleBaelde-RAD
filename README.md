### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daniele (He/Him),
Dan if you're into the whole brevity thing.

## About me

Spawned on a Monday in Sardinia, I've enjoyed its sunny beaches until the age of 25.
These days you can find me in the great oudoors of South East London.

I'm a husband, and dad of two beautiful girls.

I love the web, surfing/skateboarding, calisthenics and cooking.

## What I do

I'm a Software Engineering Manager. I've spent over twenty years in technical roles, different industries and business sizes.
